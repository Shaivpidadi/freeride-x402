"""``POST /v1/messages`` — Anthropic Messages API compatibility shim.

Lets Anthropic-format clients (Claude Code, ``@anthropic-ai/sdk``,
LiteLLM with the Anthropic adapter, etc.) talk to FreeRide as if it
were ``api.anthropic.com``. Internally we translate the request into
OpenAI Chat Completions, dispatch it through the same provider
failover machinery `/v1/chat/completions` uses, and translate the
response back into Anthropic shape on the way out.

**Phase 1 (shipped):** non-streaming chat, system prompt hoisting,
text content blocks, stop_reason and usage mapping, tool-definition
request-side translation.

**Phase 2 (this commit):** streaming SSE. We pre-flight the first
chunk through ``try_stream_with_failover`` (same buffer-first-chunk
guarantee the chat route uses), then a translator generator turns
OpenAI streaming chunks into Anthropic SSE events
(message_start / content_block_start / content_block_delta /
content_block_stop / message_delta / message_stop). Text-only blocks
in this phase; tool_use streaming lands in Phase 3.

**Phase 3 (deferred):** tool_use blocks in messages, tool_result
handling, the ``input_json_delta`` partial-JSON streaming state
machine.

The failover walk lives in :mod:`freeride.core.failover` so this
route and the other protocol shims stay in lockstep.

    #
    # ``auto_resolution_providers`` is what gets passed to the
    # catalog fetch + resolver. ``providers`` (the full preset-
