"""FastAPI app factory for the FreeRide gateway.

The server is the heart of v3: an OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface that
agents point at instead of OpenRouter/NIM/etc. directly. Phase 2 lands
``/health``, ``/v1/models``, and non-streaming ``/v1/chat/completions``;
Phase 3 adds streaming + a second provider; Phase 5 wires the hourly
opt-in telemetry beacon.

We use a factory (``create_app``) instead of a module-level ``app =``
so tests can construct fresh app instances and the CLI can pass
provider registries / config in.
